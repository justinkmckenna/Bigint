# bigint
This was my first project for CSII; I created an ADT called bigint.
The purpose of bigint was to solve the digit size issue that came with using regular ints within c++.
Using an standard array, I implemented methods and overloaded operators to make a custom ADT.
All the files were made by me from scratch with the exception of a few of the test case files in the beginning (test_default_ctor, test_int_ctor, test_c_str_ctor, and test_multiply).
