# bigint
This was my first project for CSII; I created an ADT called bigint.
The purpose of bigint was to solve the digit size issue that came with using regular ints within c++.
Using an standard array, I implemented methods and overloaded operators to make a custom ADT.
All the files were made by me from scratch with the exception of a few of the test case files in the beginning (test_default_ctor, test_int_ctor, test_c_str_ctor, test_equal, and test_multiply were supplied from my instructor).
The Makefile was also supplied to me via my instructor. Also, data1-1.txt and data1-2.txt are not test cases but are used within add.cpp and multiply.cpp to test the overloaded input operator >>.
